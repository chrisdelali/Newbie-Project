# Newbie-Project
This project is for Python Newbies like myself.
Why this project was created? Based on this concept,
"How can we understand and learn the back-end side (programming); if we don't even know how to use Python as front-end or end-users?"

Many newbies (especially those who are non-programmers or non-developers with no computer or programming related education and background) get lost with all the jargon (computer terminologies); thus, creating confusion and frustration to many.

Yes, there are plenty of tutorials out there; but again, 
though newbies who can speak and write in English still get confused and lost with all the jargons 
(words and phrases) being used in these tutorials.

I considered myself computer literate person who can proficiently install and 
use off-the-shelves softwares and mobile apps; but still get lost.

I understand that every industry or sector has their own jargons and terminologies (like in the medical field).
Learning computer programming languages reminded me when I was just starting to play poker seriously.
I hear other players speaking in English but yet, for people who doesn't play poker or newbies,
they have no idea what pockets are, big-slick, what premium hands are, runner-runner, flop, streets, open-ender, draw, etc.

But I'm pretty sure, just like when I was a newbie in poker, 
I AM CONFIDENT I CAN PASS BEING A NEOPHYTE IN THIS COMPUTER PROGRAMMING WORLD

So, the goal of this project is to LEARN TOGETHER, SHARE OUR KNOWLEDGE, and EXPERIENCES with each other.
This project also welcomes every level of Python knowledge and experiences.
We all could use any help we can; yes, even an advice whether we are heading in the right directions or not.

So, here's the project plan (so far)
CREATE A SIMPLE WEBSITE using DJANGO CMS
MASTER PYTHON & DJANGO as End-Users and from there, 
based on "reverse engineering concept",
we hope to learn how to customized existing modules/packages according to our own preferences.

Any advice, suggestion; heck, even a treat... would be greatly appreciated.
