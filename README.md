# Newbie-Project
This project is for Python Newbies like myself.
I want learn Python programming language and find myself getting lost with all the jargon (computer lingo or terminologies) that I have encountered.
I considered myself a proficient front-end user. I can pretty much install and figure out how to use a finished product (an application).

So, I am asking if you (or know someone) who can help me out with this.
